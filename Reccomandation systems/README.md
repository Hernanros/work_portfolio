# Recommendation systems
This project was created as a Homework assignment in Y-data's Supervised learning course.<br>
In this project, I implement a simple recommendation system to generate escape room recommendations.<br>
I start by implementing a simple rating based Reccomandation, afterward, I write a naive implementation for a Jaccard score based recommendation system, and O finish by comparing the performance of different algorithms from the [Surprise packacge](http://surpriselib.com/).
