# Recommendation systems
This project was created as an Homework assignment in Y-data's Supervised learning course.<br>
In this project I implement a simple reccomendation system to generate escape room reccomendations.<br>
I start by implementing a simple rating based Reccomandation, afterwards I write a naive implemntation for a Jaccard score based reccomendation system, and O finish by comparing preformence of different algorithms from the [Surprise packacge](http://surpriselib.com/).
