# Genetic Algorithm assignment
This project was a Homework assignment for Y-data Unsupervised learning class.<br>
In this assignment we experienced for the first time with Genetic Algorithms (GAs), 
starting from a basic implementation, continuing with dedicated improvements, and later applying it in various unsupervised machine learning scenarios.
