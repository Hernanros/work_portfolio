# U.K Accidents Interactive Dashboard
This project is an interactive dashboard that displays information about car accidents Data in the U.K made by Hezi Hershkovitz and myself.<br>
the purpose of this project wads to expirement with [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) - a visualization API that is very useful in bulding dashboards.<br>
The project was created as a part of a Homework assignment for Y-Data python for Data science course.
The assignment was to take the public U.K accident data and to use our imgaination to present interesting finding about the data.<br>
We used a fraction of 5000 data points to build this dashboard as an example of the possibilities entailed in Bokeh.<br>
We published a [tutorial](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/having-fun-with-bokeh-server-app-part-iv-tutorial-af4b3f2b1ef8)  that details much of the work that was done in building the dashboard and using Heroku servers
The dashboard can be found [here](https://ukaccidents.herokuapp.com/ukaccidents). check it out
