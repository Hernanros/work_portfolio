 portfolio of Data science projects
## Summary
This is a reposotory that showcases some of the data projects that I've been working on in the past year.<br>
Since April 2019, when I first started to engage in machine learning and Data science, I've participated in more than 20 different projects. some of them are copyright protected and could not be displayed for legal reasons.<br>
I picked only few projects to display in the repository since I feel that they cover a wide range of abalities and assignments I engaged in. <br>

# Super Resolution convolutional nets <br>
- Image quality enhancement project that explores and combines different deep learning techniques. In this project we (Shaul Solomon and myself) deploy different convolutions, sampling, augmanting and image manipulating methods 

# Word embeddings<br>
- NLP project in which we use word2vec embeddings method to explore relations between different word in a corpus that includes hundrers of thousend of lyrics. in this project we (Shaul Solomon and myself) expriment with many stages of the NLP project pipeline - pre-processing, embedding, exploring token-relations.

# U.K accidents<br>
 - a Visualization projects in which we (Hezi Hershkovitz and myself) created an interactive dashboard that present in an engaging manner different aspects of car-accidents data; severity, casualties, nearest hospital, time of the accident etc.

# Reccomendation system<br>
- An implementation of simple reccomendation system that can be used to help consumer pick out an escape room based on comparing other consumers similarities and past behaviors.

# Genetic Algorithms<br>
- An assignment in whic I implement an unspuervised aproach that was new to me. I Implement a class that simulates ecolution of algorithms based on their capability to preform automatic clustering challenges.

# House price prediction<br>
- my first ever data project. it was my introduction both to machine learning and python coding. this project covers all the steps in a Machine learning project pipeline: from data exploration, through cleaning, feature engineering, testing different models and enssembling.
