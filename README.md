# My work portfolio - Hernan Rosenblum

## About me
 My name is Hernan, I have a masters degree in Social Psychology from Ben Gurion University. <br>
 I have a strong understanding of quantitative research methods and a passion for structural problem-solving.<br>
 during my master's degree, I've found myself more and more drawn into the field of data manipulation and analysis.<br>
 In the past year, I've been learning how to code in python from scratch, and how to implement my knowledge and experience in conducting researches in an automated, big-scaled environment.<br>

## Summary
This is a repository that showcases some of the data projects that I've been working on in the past year.
Since April 2019, when I first started to engage in machine learning and data science, I've participated in more than 20 different projects. some of them are copyright protected and could not be displayed for legal reasons.
I picked only a few projects to display in the repository since I feel that they cover a wide range of abilities and assignments I engaged in. 

### Super Resolution convolutional nets 
- Image quality enhancement project that explores and combines different deep learning techniques. In this project, we ([Shaul Solomon](https://github.com/ShaulSolomon) and myself) deploy different convolutions, sampling, augmenting and image manipulating methods 

### Word embeddings
- NLP project in which we use the word2vec embeddings method to explore relations between the different words in a corpus that includes hundreds of thousands of lyrics. in this project, we (Shaul Solomon and myself) experiment with many stages of the NLP project pipeline - pre-processing, embedding, exploring token-relations.

### U.K accidents
 - Visualization projects in which we ([Hezi Hershkovitz](https://github.com/hershkoy) and myself) created an interactive dashboard that presents in an engaging manner different aspects of car-accidents data; severity, casualties, nearest hospital, time of the accident, etc.

### Recommendation system
- An implementation of a simple recommendation system that can be used to help consumers pick out an escape room based on comparing other consumers' similarities and past behaviors.

### Genetic Algorithms
- An assignment in which I implement an unsupervised approach that was new to me. I Implement a class that simulates the evolution of algorithms based on their capability to perform automatic clustering challenges.

### House price prediction
- My first ever data project. it was my introduction both to machine learning and python coding. this project covers all the steps in a Machine learning project pipeline: from data exploration, through cleaning, feature engineering, testing different models, and ensembling.
