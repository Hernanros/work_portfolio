# Predictiong Ames house pricing
This project was made as a Kaggle competition submission for the Ames house prices prediction.<br>
this is the very first data project I have ever done. in retrospective, there is a LOT of repetitive work that I would do much better today.<br>
I decided to include this project in my work portfolio since it does showcase a complete project pipeline that includes:
  - Exploration of the data
  - feature engineering
  - plotting important information
  - ML experimentation
  - Ensemble models<br>

I've spent a few weeks on this project, my best submission got to the 359th place put of 4465 (at the time), 92nd percentile.
