# Predictiong Ames house pricing
This project was made as a Kaggle competition submission for the [Ames house prices prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).<br>
this is the very first data project I have ever done. in retrospective there is a LOT of repetitive work that I would do much better today.<br>
I decided to include this project in my work portfolio since it does showcase a complete project pipeline that includes:<br>
1. Exploration of the data
2. feature engeneering
3. plotting important information
4. ML expirimantiation
5. Enssemble models<br>

I've spent a few weeks on this project, my best submission got to the 359th place put of 4465 (at the time) , 92nd percentile.
